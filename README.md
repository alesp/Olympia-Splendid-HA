# Home Assistant integration for Olympia Splendid air conditioner

You need a Broadlink's RM4(c) IR remote to use this integration.

### Install using HACS

Add the repository https://github.com/alesp/Olympia-Splendid-HA via HACS and install the Olympia Splendid Integration.

Restart Home Assistant after the installation is complete.

After Home Assistant restarts, add the Olympia Splendid integration.

Wait for 15-20 seconds for the integration to discover your RM4 device, then select it.

In the next step, choose the sensor entity that provides the current room temperature.
